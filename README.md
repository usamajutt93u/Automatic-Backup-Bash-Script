# Automated File Backup Script  
**A DevOps-Friendly Solution for Efficient and Reliable Data Backups**  

---

## Overview  
This project provides a lightweight, Bash-based script to automate file backups in DevOps environments. It creates compressed archives of files modified within the last 24 hours and stores them in a designated directory. Ideal for CI/CD pipelines, cron jobs, or standalone backups.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Flexible**: Specify any target and destination directories as arguments.  
- **Efficient**: Backs up only files modified in the last 24 hours to optimize storage.  
- **Portable**: Works on most Linux distributions and macOS.  
- **Scalable**: Easily integrates with cron jobs, CI/CD tools, or cloud workflows.

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- Linux/macOS system with Bash.  
- `tar` and `cron` (for scheduling).  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-backup-script.git  
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd automated-backup-script  
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh  
   ```

---

## Usage  

### Basic Execution  
Run the script with the target and destination directories as arguments:
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh /path/to/target_directory /path/to/destination_directory  
   ```

#### Example  
   ```bash
   ./backup.sh /home/user/important-documents /mnt/backup-storage  
   ```

### Scheduling with Cron  
To automate daily backups:

1. Open the crontab editor:
   ```bash
   crontab -e  
   ```

2. Add this line to run the script daily at midnight:
   ```bash
   0 0 * * * /path/to/backup.sh /target/path /destination/path  
   ```

## Enhancements & Integrations  

### Cloud Storage Integration  
Upload backups to AWS S3, Google Cloud, or Azure using CLI tools:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp backup-*.tar.gz s3://your-bucket-name/  
   ```

### AI/ML-Driven Improvements  
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use Python libraries like scikit-learn to flag unexpected file changes.
- **Predictive Backups**: Train models to predict high-risk periods and adjust backup frequency.

### Monitoring & Alerts  
- **Slack/Email Notifications**: Use curl or tools like sendmail to notify on backup success/failure.
- **ELK Stack**: Centralize logs for real-time monitoring with Elasticsearch and Kibana.
